## About The Project
![image](anomalydetection_app/assets/demo.png)

This project defines a Dash app to explore anomaly detection for time series data.

The app allows you to 
* select which data patterns and types of noise to simulate
* try different anomaly detection approaches to see their effect on the simulated data. 

### Built With

The following projects were used to build this project:
* [Dash Bootstrap Components](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/)
* [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/)
* [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)
* [anomalydetection](https://github.com/DHI/anomalydetection/)


## Getting Started

This section contains instructions to run the app locally.

### Download code
First, make sure you have the code locally. There are different ways to download the code:

* Clone using git if you have git installed: 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DHI/anomalydetection_app.git
   ```
 * Or download az zip file using the "Code" button on https://github.com/DHI/anomalydetection_app

### Installation
You can either install this project as a package using Poetry, or install the requirements.

#### Install project as package

#### Install project requirements


### Running app
To run app, do the following:

1. In the command prompt, navigate to the folder where app.py is located
2. Run the following from the command line:
`python app.py`

## Usage



## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/DHI/anomalydetection_app/issues) for a list of proposed features 
(and known issues).


## Contributing
You are very welcome to open pull requests with new features, e.g. new noise types or data patterns to simulate,
more buttons to control input to anomaly detectors and so on.
Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
